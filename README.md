Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).


## Getting started
---------------

This is a version of the Arcade Game "Frogger".
There is no need to install anything before you can start playing the game. The game runs on any browser which has JavaScript enabled.
Simply open the index.html file in the browser.

## How to play
---------------

You have a **Player** and **Enemies** in this Game.
The goal of the game is that the player has to _reach the water._
The bugs which are running at different speeds from left to right are your enemies.
You have to cross the grass, the stones and get to the water without colliding with them. Beware of the enemies, once you collide with them, the game resets and you have to start again.
If you get to the water succesfully, the game also resets and you can play it again.

#### The following keys can be used to control the player:
* up arrow: to move the player up
* down arrow: to move the player down
* left arrow: to move the player left
* right arrow: to move the player right
